# Selenium Automationo Challenge

https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/

This challenge is intended to give you an introduction to the features of selenium.
The goal is to learn how to use selenium to automate a task on the web that can't be done by BeautifulSoup and Requests.

## Tasks

You ordered some packages that were shipped by either FedEx or UPS (this example uses FedEx, but you can use UPS or any other carrier you'd like). It says it was delivered, however you don't see your packages. On the carrier's website, you can find "proof of delivery" when you track your order. Since you have SO MANY packages to track, you decided you wanted to automate getting the proof of delivery document for all your tracking numbers.

**For privacy purposes, no tracking numbers are supplied with this exercise, you must supply your own.**

For each tracking number, go to the carrier's tracking page and use Selenium to download the proof of delivery.

## Skill Levels

Depeding on your skill level, you should start with the following configuration.

**Absolute Beginner:**
Take a look at `app.py` and browse through the Selenium documentation to see if you can understand what is going on.

**Novice:**
Copy `requirements.txt` and `start.py` to your directory. Install the required packages. Work through the problem as best as you can. Look at `app.py` if you need help.

**Junior:**
Copy `requirements.txt` and `start.py` to your directory. Install the required packages. Work through the problem as best as you can. Try not to look at `app.py`.

**Senior:**
Copy `start.py` to your directory. Figure out what packages you need to install and work through the problems as best as you can. Fill out `start.py` to complete the challenge.

**Professional:**
You have a blank slate. Make it all happen.
